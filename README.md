# What is the advantage of rolling multiple dice and picking the highest?

The expected average of rolling one 6-face die is

$\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5$

But what if you can roll multiple of them and pick the highest number within your results? How does the expexted value increase?

And how does this depend on the number of faces?

This problem was inspired by the video [The unexpected logic behind rolling multiple dice and picking the highest.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_DdGRjtwAo)
